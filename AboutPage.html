                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">My name is Mad Watcher. I'm a shy but smart guy who’s known for getting the job done whenever possible. I love to go hunting, as I like to go outside and see nature, while being able to shoot stuff. I specifically like to go duck hunting, and when I do get some ducks, I turn them into duck jerky.<br><br>On weekends, I like to unwind with a round of golf. It's a sport that's really calm and there isn't really any sport like it. When I’m at home, you can usually find me gaming. I love diving into immersive worlds, and getting lost in a good storyline.<br><br>Every now and then, I'll put on a movie, but I’m a bit picky about what I watch. I like to choose films that really grab my attention or make me think, so I'm selective about what I spend my time on.</p>

                  For me that's hard to do, since I like a lot of video games and played a lot of them. But at least for now my top 5 games for me are<br><br><strong>5: </strong>Red Dead Redemption 2<br><strong>4: </strong>Fallout New Vegas<br><strong>3: </strong>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl<br><strong>2: </strong>Yakuza 0<br><strong>1: </strong>Resident Evil 4 (2005)<br><br><strong><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em></strong> is a true masterpiece, combining top-tier storytelling with one of the most immersive open worlds ever made. Set in the late 1800s, you play as Arthur Morgan, a hardened outlaw and key member of the Van der Linde gang. As the world shifts toward industrialization, Arthur struggles with his loyalty to the gang, his own sense of morality, and the inevitable collapse of the outlaw way of life. The story pulls you in with its complex characters and tough choices—choices that linger with you long after the credits roll. Arthur’s journey feels deeply personal, and the weight of his decisions hits harder than in most games. The world itself is incredible. Every part of the map feels alive, from the wildlife that reacts to your presence to NPCs who treat you differently based on your reputation. The level of detail is insane—shifting weather, seasonal changes, and towns that feel as real as the wilderness around them. Combat is smooth and satisfying, and exploration is always rewarding. Whether you’re hunting, fishing, or stumbling across a hidden side story, there’s always something to do. The pacing strikes a perfect balance between intense action and quieter moments that let you fully absorb the world. It’s a long game, no doubt, but every moment feels earned. The story pieces fit together beautifully, and is probably my favorite story Rockstar Games has ever told.&nbsp;<br><br><strong><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></strong> is one of the best in the Fallout series, combining first-person shooting with classic RPG mechanics. Set in the post-apocalyptic Mojave Desert, you play as the Courier, someone who gets shot in the head and left for dead. Somehow, you survive and end up smack in the middle of a power struggle between factions vying for control of New Vegas. What really sets this game apart is how much your choices matter. The story shifts based on what you do, and the world reacts to your decisions in ways that feel meaningful. The Mojave is packed with hidden spots to discover and unforgettable characters to meet. The factions—like the NCR, Caesar’s Legion, and Mr. House—each have their own philosophies, and the way you interact with them shapes your experience. Combat is a mix of fast-paced shooting and strategic RPG mechanics, like the VATS system, where you can target specific body parts in slow motion. Sure, there are some bugs (it’s a Bethesda-published game, after all), but since it was developed by Obsidian Entertainment, the strong story, atmosphere, and player freedom truly shine. It is one of my favorite RPGs of all time and anyone who is even slightly interested in it should give it a go, just make sure to follow the Viva New Vegas modding guide to get it running to its best.<br><br>(<a href="https://vivanewvegas.moddinglinked.com/index.html" class="text-white text-primary" target="_blank">Viva New Vegas modding guide</a>)&nbsp;<br><br><strong><em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl</em></strong> is a gritty mix of survival horror and first-person shooting, set in the eerie wasteland around the Chernobyl disaster site. You play as a "Stalker," scavenging and fighting to survive in the Zone—a place crawling with mutated creatures, hostile factions, and weird, deadly anomalies. The atmosphere is bleak and oppressive, with every corner of the world feeling broken and decayed.<br>The game doesn’t baby you. You’ve got to keep an eye on your inventory, avoid deadly radiation, and face off against tough enemies. Combat can feel brutal at first, but that just makes it all the more satisfying when you get the hang of it. The factions you run into all have their own agendas, but the game isn’t about making moral decisions or alliances—it’s about staying alive and exploring this dangerous, haunting world.<br>What really sets S.T.A.L.K.E.R. apart is its atmosphere. The silence of the Zone is almost suffocating, broken only by the distant growl of a mutant or the unsettling tones of the soundtrack. Every step feels like it could be your last. So stock up on vodka, and remember—cheeki breeki.<br><br><strong><em>Yakuza 0</em></strong> is a wild, action-packed ride set in the neon-soaked streets of 1980s Japan. You play as two unforgettable characters: Kazuma Kiryu, a fresh-faced Yakuza member trying to prove himself, and Goro Majima, a charismatic loose cannon clawing his way back into the crime world after being exiled. Their stories are gripping, full of twists, betrayals, and some truly gut-punching moments of character development. The combat is a blast, with each character having multiple fighting styles that let you pummel enemies in stylish, over-the-top ways. Whether you're throwing haymakers as Kiryu or spinning like a breakdancing tornado as Majima, the fights are always satisfying and packed with energy. But the real magic of Yakuza 0 lies in its side content. The main story is serious and dramatic, but step away for a second, and you’ll find yourself singing karaoke, managing a cabaret club, disco dancing, or getting involved in some hilariously bizarre side quests. These moments add a ton of humor and heart, giving you a break from all the punching and plotting. Yakuza 0 is a really fun with a engaging story, and with an OST that is really great to listen to, this is a game I love to play multiple times.&nbsp;<br><br><strong><em>Resident Evil 4</em></strong> is one of the best action-horror games out there. You play as Leon S. Kennedy, who’s sent to rescue the president’s daughter from a creepy village in Spain. But things get much worse than he expects, and you’re thrown into a wild fight for survival. The story is gripping, with plenty of scary moments that keep you wanting to see what happens next. The combat is super fun, with an over-the-shoulder view that makes aiming and shooting feel smooth. You’ll face tons of terrifying enemies, but there’s also puzzles and exploration to break things up. The difficulty is just right—challenging, but not too hard. It keeps the tension high the whole time. The game looks great, even now, and the creepy atmosphere really pulls you in. The game is really fun to play, and I highly recommend it, I also recommend the remake too if you like Resident Evil 4<br><br>Best song in RE4 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgnZ9w5ghwE&t=59s" class="text-white text-primary" target="_blank"><strong>(song)</strong></a><br><br>For me, my favorite films I have seen are<br><br><strong>5: </strong>Back to the Future<br><strong>4: </strong>O&nbsp;Brother Where Art Thou<br><strong>3: </strong>Goodfellas<br><strong>2: </strong>Apocalypse Now<br><strong>1: </strong>Oldboy (2003, not that dogshit 2013 remake)<br><br><strong><em>Back to the Future</em></strong> is a classic time-travel movie that blends adventure, comedy, and sci-fi in a way that's still popular today. Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox, is accidentally sent back to 1955 in a DeLorean time machine built by the eccentric Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Marty’s mission? To make sure his parents meet and fall in love or risk erasing his own existence. The film does a great job of mixing humor with high stakes, as Marty tries to fix the problems he’s created in the past while also dodging trouble with a young Biff Tannen. The chemistry between Marty and Doc really drives the film and their dynamic still holds up as one of the best pairings in film history. The concept of time travel is handled in a fun way, with clever plot twists and moments that make you think. Plus, the 80’s soundtrack, especially "The Power of Love," and some late 50s tracks like "Johnny Be Good" adds to the charm. Back to the Future isn't just a time-travel movie it’s an iconic part of pop culture, and still enjoyable to watch today.<br><br><strong><em>O Brother, Where Art Thou?</em></strong> is a quirky, fun film set during the Great Depression and directed by the Coen Brothers. It follows three escaped convicts—Ulysses, Pete, and Delmar—on a mission to find buried treasure. Along the way, they end up in all kinds of trouble. The film is loosely based on Homer’s Odyssey, but with a Southern twist that makes it unique and interesting. The movie has a ton of quirky characters, like the blind prophet and the sirens, who add to the wild journey. The soundtrack is a standout too, filled with bluegrass, gospel, and folk tunes that really set the tone for the film.<br>What makes O Brother, Where Art Thou? so good is how it mixes humor with serious moments. It’s not all laughs; the film touches on themes like redemption and survival. The Coen Brothers use a lot of visual storytelling, and while it can be strange at times, it’s all part of the film’s charm. O Brother, Where Art Thou? is a fun, memorable movie that’s well worth watching.<br><br><strong><em>Goodfellas</em></strong> is a gripping crime drama directed by Martin Scorsese that gives an incredibly real and detailed look at the Mafia lifestyle. It’s based on the true story of Henry Hill, a young man who gets involved with the mob and rises through the ranks. The film shows the highs and lows of the mob life, including the violence, betrayal, and the constant tension of living on the edge. What makes Goodfellas stand out is how it really nails the authenticity of the Mafia. It doesn’t glamorize the lifestyle but instead focuses on the brutal realities—how mobsters live in constant fear, deal with betrayals, and face inevitable downfall. The way Scorsese captures the inner workings of the Mafia, from the loyalty to the backstabbing, makes it feel like an honest portrayal of how things really were. The pacing of the film is fast and intense, with quick cuts and narration that keep you hooked from start to finish. The performances are excellent, especially Ray Liotta as Henry Hill, but Joe Pesci’s role as Tommy is iconic—his temper and unpredictability bring a raw, unfiltered energy to the film. The soundtrack also plays a huge role, with songs that perfectly fit the film’s mood. Goodfellas isn’t just about crime—it’s about the friendships, the trust, and the inevitable collapse of everything once you live that life. It’s a timeless classic that shows the Mafia in a way that’s brutally honest and unforgettable.<br><br><strong><em>Apocalypse Now</em></strong> is a haunting and intense war film directed by Francis Ford Coppola, set during the Vietnam War. The film follows Captain Willard as he embarks on a dangerous mission to assassinate a rogue U.S. Colonel, Kurtz, who has gone mad and set up his own kingdom in the jungle. Based on Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, Apocalypse Now is a modern retelling that explores the psychological and moral toll of war in a similar way, but in the context of the Vietnam War. What makes Apocalypse Now stand out is how it depicts the madness of war and its effect on the human mind. It’s not just about battles or violence, but about how war breaks down the rules of civilization. Coppola uses stunning visuals and sound, creating an almost hallucinatory experience that stays with you long after the film ends. The journey through the jungle, both literal and psychological, is gripping and unsettling, making you question reality and the human capacity for cruelty. The performances are incredible, with the portrayal of Kurtz being both chilling and enigmatic. The soundtrack, especially "The End" by The Doors, adds to the haunting atmosphere and perfectly complements the film’s grim tone. Apocalypse Now is more than just a war film—it’s a cinematic masterpiece that explores the darkness within human nature, the consequences of war, and the madness that comes with it, all while drawing on the themes of Heart of Darkness in a powerful and unforgettable way.<br><br>"We train young men to drop fire on people, but their commanders won't allow them to write FUCK on their airplanes because it's obscene" is one of my favorite lines in any film ever because of how true it is.<br><br>The Horror... The Horror... The Horror...<br><br><strong><em>Oldboy</em></strong> is a gripping and intense thriller directed by Park Chan-wook that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. The story follows Oh Dae-su, a man who is mysteriously imprisoned for 15 years without knowing why. After he is suddenly released, he goes on a quest for revenge against the people responsible for his confinement. As he uncovers the truth, the film takes shocking twists that make you question everything. What makes Oldboy stand out is its clever storytelling and unforgettable moments. The pacing is fast, and the plot is full of suspense with a ton of surprises. One of the most famous scenes is the long, single-take fight in a hallway. It’s brutal but also really artistic, showing the film’s unique approach to action. The movie doesn’t shy away from violence, but it also explores deep emotional themes like revenge, guilt, and how far someone will go to get even. The performances are great, especially as the lead character goes through a tragic and complex journey. Oldboy is visually stunning, with dark and moody settings that really build the tension. The soundtrack also adds a lot to the emotional weight of the film. Oldboy is a masterpiece of modern cinema. It’s twisted, thought-provoking, and has one of the most shocking endings ever. It’s a film that sticks with you, making you think about its themes long after you’re done watching.<br></p>
